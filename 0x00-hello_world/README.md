The different steps to form an executable file from C source code are:

Preprocessing: In this step, the preprocessor performs various tasks such as including header files, expanding macros, and removing comments. The output of this step is a preprocessed source code file.

Compilation: The compiler takes the preprocessed source code and translates it into assembly language code specific to the target architecture. This step produces an assembly code file.

Assembly: The assembler takes the assembly code and translates it into machine code or object code. This step generates an object file that contains the machine code instructions.

Linking: The linker combines the object files generated from multiple source code files, along with any necessary libraries, to create an executable file. It resolves references between different parts of the code and generates the final executable file.
